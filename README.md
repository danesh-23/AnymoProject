# AnymoProject
Create a carousel to be used as an imported package for external users. Designed a SwiftUI carousel component to be used similar to how Anymo's carousels are used for its end-users. Completed as a interview-project for Anymo.


### Installation
#### 1. Install the UnflowInterviewApp package.
#### 2. Import UnflowInterviewApp in the Swift file you want to use the carousel in.
#### 3. Instantiate a CarouselItem/s object by passing in the header and body text as well as the image names for the background and optional center display image.
#### 4. Instantiate a Carousel object by passing in your array of CarouselItem/s and optional custom button texts for the main button as well as the last page button.
### VOILA! You should have a fully functioning carousel view thats completely integratable in iOS 13 onwards with SwiftUI.
 
### Potential Improvements (exceeding time constraint)
- Add support for previous iOS versions.
- Allow for more dynamism for carousel and its items aside from only having header and body texts and background and 1 display image and one button at the bottom.
- Extra animations when moving between views etc.
- Add extra test cases for current test suite as well as including UI tests.
- Allow for more action buttons such as navigating to different part of your app or open a website up when clicking buttons and being able to extend the Carousel to handle this.
